🚀 Cybersecurity Enthusiast | SDSU Student | Project Manager

Hi there! 👋 I'm passionate about cybersecurity and committed to building secure systems that empower innovation. Currently studying Cybersecurity at San Diego State University, I bring a unique blend of technical curiosity and professional experience as a Project Manager in the field of autonomous software.

🛡️ What drives me?

Uncovering vulnerabilities and crafting resilient solutions.
Collaborating to bridge technical expertise with clear communication.
Exploring new ways to make technology safer and more accessible.
🧗‍♂️ When I'm not analyzing systems or managing projects, you can find me scaling indoor rock walls, always looking for the next challenge to conquer!

Let’s connect and build something amazing together. 🌐
