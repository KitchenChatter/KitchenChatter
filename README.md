- 👋 Hi, I’m Chef Owens @KitchenChatter
- 👀 I’m interested in cooking up automation test cases, using Selenium WebDriver as the core automation tool for testing web applications. I use Python
- for coding. To write the test scenarios and steps, I use Behave, which is a behavior-driven development(BDD) framework that allows me to cookup test cases in natural language format. For report generation, I use Allure which generates HTML reports. Finally, for cross-browser testing, I user BroswerStack, whcih allows me to run tests on different browsers and devices. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning at Careerist for QA automation, and work on the autonomy team as a Lead Operations Specialist @DoorDashLabs...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on other automation projects...
